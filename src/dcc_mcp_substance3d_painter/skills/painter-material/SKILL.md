# Painter material

Painter's material surface is a set of typed channels carried by a texture-set
stack, plus the per-layer choice of which of those channels a layer actually
contributes to. This skill works directly on that model:

- `inspect_material_channels` reads the stack's channel inventory - label,
  storage format, bit depth, and whether the channel is colour data. Use it to
  discover the exact channel names a stack supports before addressing one.
- `set_layer_channels` replaces the set of channels a layer contributes. Painter
  calls this the layer's active channels, and it is the switch that decides
  whether a layer writes colour, roughness, height, and so on.
- `set_layer_channel_value` writes one uniform value into one channel of an
  existing layer. This is the primitive behind a flat fill; it does not paint.

Channel names are resolved against `textureset.ChannelType` on the running host
rather than being hard-coded, because the available channels depend on the
project's shader. An unknown name fails with the supported list attached.

`inspect_material_channels` is read-only. The two mutating tools do not delete
anything and are idempotent: re-applying the same channel set or the same value
converges to the same state.

**Verification contract.** Channel activation is confirmed by reading the layer's
active channels back from Painter, so it is reported as verified. A uniform
channel *value* has no host readback in Painter's Python API, so
`set_layer_channel_value` confirms only that the target channel is active
afterwards and reports `verified=False` for the value itself. Do not treat it as
proof that the intended colour reached the texture.
